## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality:
- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices (hooks, components)
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Testing Strategy:
- Manual testing on each device type
- Performance testing with multiple drawings
- Edge case testing (window resize, etc.)
- User acceptance testing with stakeholders

### Git Workflow:
- Create feature branches for each phase
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Test thoroughly before merging
- Keep main branch always deployable

### Performance Targets:
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s  
- **Animation Frame Rate**: Consistent 60fps
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB initial load

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Performance on mobile**: Start testing early, implement fallbacks
- **Physics complexity**: Keep collision detection simple initially
- **Browser compatibility**: Test on real devices, not just devtools
- **Animation smoothness**: Use transform3d, avoid layout thrashing

### Scope Risks:
- **Feature creep**: Stick to MVP first, enhance later
- **Perfect animations**: Good enough is better than perfect
- **Content delays**: Use placeholder content initially

### Timeline Risks:
- **Physics debugging**: Allocate extra time for collision detection
- **Cross-browser issues**: Test early and often
- **Mobile optimization**: Don't leave mobile testing until the end
